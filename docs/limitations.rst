Limitations of Typedpy
======================


.. currentmodule:: typedpy

.. contents:: :local:


Nothing is perfect, and Typedpy has several trade-offs and limitations:

Not Incorporated into IDE
-------------------------
| Typedpy is not supported by the IDE code analysis, so there are no warnings/errors that are specific to Typedpy in the IDE.
| Errors are found at run-time. There are workaround, like creating a hybrid Structure/dataclass, as explain in :ref:`hybrid` ,
| but it is still a limitation.

| However, since version 2.14, Typedpy allows to easily generate Python Interface files. These files are read automatically
| by Pycharm, and will result it correct intellisense.

Not Optimized for Speed
-----------------------
| Typedpy is not optimized for speed, especially when dealing with immutables. If speed is absolutely crucial, you need to be aware of that.


Implicit Arbitrary Class Wrappers Are not Pickalable
----------------------------------------------------
| Starting with version 2.1, Typedpy supports using arbitrary classes as field types, as described in :ref:`arbitrary-classes`.
| However, if you use the implicit conversion feature in your structure, your data instance cannot be pickled.
| Typedpy will raise an appropriate exception if you try to do it, so you will be protected from silent failures.


Type Hints Usage Can be Confusing
---------------------------------
| Typedpy Field types should not be used in type hints instead of the Python types they refer to.
| The reason is that the :class:`Field` class is not the same as the type of the content. For example,
| Array[String] is not the same as list[str], and :class:`String` is not the same as str.

To demonstrate, if we have the following structure:

.. code-block:: python

    class Example1(Structure):
        names_by_id: Map[String, Array[String]]
        ...


The following type hint for the return value is wrong:

.. code-block:: python

    def  get_names_for_id(id: str, example: Example) -> Array[String]:


| The correct return type should be list[str].  However, if we want to keep the type hints consistent
| with the Structure definition, we can define it as follows:

.. code-block:: python

    class Example1(Structure):
        names_by_id: dict[str, list[str]]
        ...


Typedpy automatically converts it to its own internal class:`Field` types, but you can use type hints as usual.

.. code-block:: python

    def  get_names_for_id(id: str, example: Example) -> list[str]:
         ...


Serialization Mappers
=======================
Combining functions transformations cannot be followed by other functions and key mapping.
